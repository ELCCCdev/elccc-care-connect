# ELCCC Care Connect

ELCCC Client Portal, Counselor Workspace, and Administrative CRM stakeholder prototype built as a dependency-free, single-file `index.html` application using mock data only.

## Local preview

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:4173/
```

## Static build

```bash
npm run build
```

The build output is written to `dist/` and is ready for static hosting.

## Planning and feature status

- [`FEATURE_STATUS.md`](FEATURE_STATUS.md) audits the current prototype and distinguishes implemented, simulated, planned, and production-blocked capabilities.
- [`V2_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`](V2_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) defines the prioritized V2 workstreams, acceptance criteria, dependencies, and production security prerequisites.

These documents do not change the prototype. The repository remains a mock-data demonstration and does not claim HIPAA compliance.

## GitHub Pages deployment

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` that builds `dist/` and deploys it to GitHub Pages.

To publish publicly from GitHub:

1. Push this branch to GitHub.
2. In GitHub, open **Settings → Pages**.
3. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**.
4. Open the **Actions** tab.
5. Run **Deploy static prototype to GitHub Pages** manually, or push to `main`/`work`.
6. After the workflow finishes, open the URL shown in the workflow summary. It will usually be:

```text
https://<github-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/
```

All data displayed in the prototype is mock/demo data. The app includes the disclaimer: “Prototype only — no real client or medical data.”
